# Jarvis

Jarvis is a theoretical neuromorphic autonomous vehicle management
driving system with machine learning and artificial intelligence to mimic human
thought processes. Jarvis is the catalyst behind Shay's undergraduate research
at East Tennessee State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
culminating in an undergraduate thesis from ETSU.

## Inspiration

Given, Shay's diverse experience in the fields of mechanical and electrical
engineering from home projects, he has a strong foundation automotive mechanical
and electrical systems. Shay also has a strong interest in these topics and,
would like his future work in computing to implement and reflect his interest
of automobile mechanics, along with his growing knowledge of computer science.

## Methods of Execution

Shay would complete Jarvis through research at East Tennessee State University and
Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This theoretical partnership would afford Shay
the opportunity to work on Jarvis while completing his undergraduate degree in
his desired time frame, fours years of schooling along with one year of work
experience.

## Potential Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B w/ 4gb DDR4 RAM | $49.99

- NeuroShield (576 neurons) | $100

- NeuroShield SDK for Windows | $400

- NeuroBrick extensions (3,456 neurons) | $147

Approximate Total w/ Tax: ~$767

## Hypothetical Project Results and Milestones

Jarvis will have the capability to pilot an automotive in any environment from
the arctic tundra to the Sahara desert given detailed mapping and GPS
coordinates.

1. Develop a simulation that takes input from a neuromorphic computer with the
capability to connect with GPS coordinate and mapping systems. Using spiking
neural networks, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, Jarvis will
pilot the vehicle through as series of pre-programmed simulations representing
different environments.

## Contributors

Jarvis would be the culmination of a partnership between Oak Ridge National
Laboratory and East Tennessee State University.
